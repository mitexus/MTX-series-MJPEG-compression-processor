# MTX-series-MJPEG-compression-processor
The MTX is an Image Compression Processor series that performs the JPEG Baseline Algorithm. 
The MTX performs Discrete Cosine Transform, Quantization, and Entropy Encoding. 
It does not use any external memory and is designed to operate without any host intervention.
The MTX series has different options. Its base option is MTX001. 
It includes a Lattice Semiconductor FPGA ICE40UP5K, packaged in a 30-ball WLCSP and 
in a 48-pin VFQFN Exposed Pad, preconfigured with the MJPEG encoder IP.
